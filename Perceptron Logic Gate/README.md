# Perceptron Logic Gates
In this project, we will use perceptrons to model the fundamental building blocks of computers â€” logic gates.

For example, the table below shows the results of an AND gate. Given two inputs, an AND gate will output a 1 only if both inputs are a 1:
Input 1	Input 2	Output
0	0	0
0	1	0
1	0	0
1	1	1
